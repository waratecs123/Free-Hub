# What We're Building
**We're creating a comprehensive free software catalog from scratch.** This is original curated content, not an automated aggregation of existing listings.

## Project Essence
- **Format:** Detailed, vetted application profiles with genuine insights
- **Goal:** Present free software options clearly and honestly, without oversimplification
- **Audience:** Beginners seeking alternatives → advanced users finding specialized tools
- **Style:** "Explain like you're recommending to a colleague" - practical, with real examples

## What We're NOT Doing
- Collecting/aggregating others' listings without evaluation
- Surface-level feature copying
- Promotional or affiliate content
- Automated directory compilation

## Structure
The catalog follows a logical progression from essential tools to specialized applications, with each category building on user needs. We're evaluating and documenting everything ourselves, maintaining consistent quality and practical focus throughout.
