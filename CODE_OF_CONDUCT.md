## Golden Rule
**Be respectful.** We're here to discover and share valuable free software with others.

### Do:
- Help others find appropriate software solutions
- Politely correct inaccurate information
- Suggest genuine improvements
- Submit quality application recommendations
- Ask questions about specific software needs

### Don't:
- Insult or belittle others' technical choices
- Use discriminatory or offensive language
- Spam or engage in self-promotion
- Share personal or sensitive information
- Be aggressive in disagreements

### If Issues Arise
1. **Pause** the interaction
2. **Report** problematic behavior to maintainers
3. **We'll address it** promptly and discreetly

Violations may result in a warning, temporary restriction, or permanent removal from the project.

**Goal:** Create a collaborative, inclusive environment for sharing knowledge about free software alternatives.
